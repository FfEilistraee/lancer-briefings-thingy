## CONFIDENTIAL // EYES ONLY  
**Contract ID:** DC-001 // Designation: "First Footfall"  

**Issuing Authority:** Orpheus Extraction & Survey **(OES-Sector Command)**  
**Primary Contractor Team:** **[Rustwatch]**  

*"Hope's a currency, and you're all bankrupt."*  

---  

## **SITUATION OVERVIEW**  
**Target Planet:** Elysion-9 ("Pandora"), Phaethon System  
**Orbital Approach:** Via Icarus Gate  
**Surface LZ:** 1.2 clicks south of Charon Ring Gate  

**Hostile Forces Confirmed On-Site:**  
- **Ozymandias Heavy Industries**  
  **Priority Threat:** Primary competitor for Lumenite-M9 extraction rights. Engage with extreme prejudice.  

- **Ironjackals**  
  Irregular mercenary forces. High aggression, low discipline. Avoid unnecessary engagements.  

- **Echelon Sovereign**  
  Expected deployment within 48h. Management advises caution—**do not provoke unless fired upon.**  

**OES Intelligence Update:** Rivals are fortifying near Charon Gate. Lose this foothold, all future contracts in-system default to Hephaestus-controlled bids.  

---  

## **OPERATIONAL DIRECTIVES**  
1. **Secure Drop Zone "Golgotha"**  
   - Establish perimeter before rival forces reinforce.  

2. **Neutralize Ozymandias Convoy (Grid Ref: 44-CHARON)**  
   - Destroy or capture Lumenite-M9 shipments marked for Hephaestus Foundry.  

3. **Eliminate Ozymandias Scout Patrols**  
   - Prevent early warning of OES operations.  

4. **Intercept Ozymandias Train (Cargo: "Lumenite-M9 Core Samples")**  
   - Deny enemy resupply. Recover samples for OES R&D.  

---  

## **CONTRACT STAKES (PER CLAUSE 7-B)**  
- **Success:** OES grants **priority salvage rights** within 50km of Charon Gate (20% gross yield).  
- **Failure:** Contract void. Squad's remaining debts to OES will be sold to **Echelon Sovereign collectors.**  

*Godspeed.*

> ## **ADDENDUM // BACKGROUND INTELLIGENCE**  
**Orpheus Extraction & Survey (OES)** operates under provisional charter from **Hephaestus Foundry** (see Annex 7-H for deniability protocols). Current contract executed by **Rustwatch Team-35** (last surviving unit from **Mirrorsmoke Logistics** debtor pool).  

**Note:** Previous Rustwatch iterations (Teams 28-34) were lost during **Operation: STALWART** (Phaethon System). No recovery attempts authorized.  

**Ozymandias Heavy Industries** maintains an unregistered processing facility (**Site Anubis-7**) in Elysion-9's northern cryo-volcanic zone. Intelligence suggests:  
- Primary Lumenite-M9 refinement capacity  
- Automated defense grid (pattern **"WATCHDOG-9"**)  
- Rail terminus for core sample shipments to Charon Gate  

**Priority Directive:** Secure Lumenite-M9 samples from convoy. Material analysis may reveal:  
- Ozymandias' breach of **Galactic Resource Accords** (Article 12)  
- Forensic links to **"Lethe Contingency"** (see Case File **MS-3310** for Mirrorsmoke collapse)  

**Document expires 24hrs post-transmission.**
