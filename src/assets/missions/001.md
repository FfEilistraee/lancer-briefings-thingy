## CONFIDENTIAL // EYES ONLY  
**Contract ID:** DC-001 // Designation: "First Footfall"  

**Issuing Authority:** Orpheus Extraction & Survey **(OES-Sector Command)**  
**Primary Contractor Team:** **[Rustwatch]**  

*“Hope’s a currency, and you’re all bankrupt.”*

---  

## **SITUATION OVERVIEW**  
**Target Planet:** Elysion-9 ("Pandora")  
**Status:** Contested (Corporate LZ established 1.2 clicks south of DZ)  

**Hostile Forces Confirmed On-Site:**
- **Ozymandias Heavy Industries**  
  **Priority Threat:** Primary competitor for resource monopoly. Engage with extreme prejudice.  

- **Ironjackals**  
  Irregular mercenary forces. High aggression, low discipline. Avoid unnecessary engagements.  

- **Echelon Sovereign**  
  Expected deployment within 48h. Management advises caution—**do not provoke unless fired upon.**  

**OES Intelligence Update:** Rivals are fortifying positions. Lose this foothold, and all future contracts on Lethe default to Hephaestus-controlled bids.  

---  

## **OPERATIONAL DIRECTIVES**  
1. **Secure Drop Zone "Golgotha"**  
   - Establish perimeter before rival forces reinforce.  

2. **Neutralize Ozymandias Convoy (Grid Ref: 44-CHARON)**  
   - Destroy or capture cargo marked for Hephaestus Foundry.  

3. **Eliminate Ozymandias Scout Patrols**  
   - Prevent early warning of OES operations.  

4. **Intercept Ozymandias Train (Cargo: "Acheron-Grade Alloys")**  
   - Deny enemy resupply. Recover alloys for OES Salvage Division.  

---  

## **CONTRACT STAKES (PER CLAUSE 7-B)**  
- **Success:** OES grants **priority salvage rights** on Elysion-9’s first dig sites (20% gross yield).  
- **Failure:** Contract void. Squad’s remaining debts to OES will be sold to **Echelon Sovereign collectors.**  

*Godspeed.*

> ## **ADDENDUM // BACKGROUND INTELLIGENCE**  
**Orpheus Extraction & Survey (OES)** operates under **Hephaestus Foundry** charter, though this affiliation is **deniable**. Contracts are frequently outsourced to **"Rustwatch"**—a disposable strike team composed of debt-bound contractors (see: **you**).

**Ozymandias Heavy Industries** maintains a **classified forward base** (codenamed **"Anubis-7"**) in Elysion-9’s northern hemisphere. Location is **unknown**, but intercepts confirm it houses the **Acheron-grade alloy stockpile**.  

**Using whatever means necessary**, secure the train cargo. Recovered materials may contain **encrypted manifests** referencing the **"Lethe Contingency"**—a project that bankrupted your previous employer, **Mirrorsmoke Logistics**, and left your squad indentured to OES.
