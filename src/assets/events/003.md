(*A long exhale.* The hum of a dying ship’s reactor. When he speaks, his voice is quiet, rough—like he’s unused to talking to no one.)

"**CROWNBREAKER** They called it ‘The Awakening.’ Funny. Felt more like... peeling off skin. Layer by layer. Until there was nothing left but what they wanted."

(A pause. The *creak* of a bunk shifting.)

"First time I woke up after surgery, I asked for my mother. The tech sighed—like I was a glitching machine. **‘Oh. You can still ask for that? That’s… unfortunate.’** Adjusted something on the IV. **‘Don’t worry. You won’t need to think much longer.’** He was right. After that, it was just wires. Just orders."

(A sharp, metallic sound—maybe a knife scraping against the floor.)

"Fernando asked me once what my first memory was. I told him it was the taste of antiseptic. He thought I was joking. I wasn’t."

(Silence. Then, softer:)

*"I remember... before. Bits. A blue blanket. Someone singing. But it’s like it happened to someone else. Like they scraped him out of me and left this... thing. This ***CB-Q54***."*

(A sudden, bitter laugh.)

"But then Fernando. Stupid, stubborn Fernando. He’d shove rations into my hands and say, ‘Eat, you idiot.’ Like I was a person. Like I mattered. And one day... I realized I wanted to live. Not just obey. Live."

(The sound of something clattering—a bottle? A weapon? His voice tightens.)

"Now he’s gone. And I’m here. In this fucking tin can. With this body they built. And I don’t know what to do with it. Except break things. That’s all I’ve ever been good for."

(A long pause. When he speaks again, it’s barely audible:)

*"... But I don’t want to break things anymore."*
