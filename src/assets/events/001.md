**MACBETH HIGH COMMAND â€“ INTERNAL MEMORANDUM**

**REF**: MHC/3AUX/7742-9

**DATE**: x.yy.50zzU

**From**: Colonel **Elias Vrost**, 3rd Auxiliary Command

**To**: HighCom Personnel Oversight

Gamma Security Clearance

**Subject**: Operational Assessment - **Bloodsworth**, A. (Domita-Spes Lineage)

At your request, I'm providing an updated assessment of Subject **Bloodsworth**'s current status and operational readiness following his reassignment to 3rd Auxiliary Support Wing **Scrap Rats**.

The subject continues to perform *adequately in his voluntary demotion* to Mech Maintenance Supervisor at **Charon** Outpost, though his tendency to excessively question Rules of Engagement protocols remains a concern. The lingering effects of Incident **K-7742-9** (**Kessig VI**) persist, with lower ranks increasingly romanticizing what was, in operational terms, a clear failure to follow direct orders. This narrative is proving problematic for unit discipline.

The subject persists in displaying Bloodsworth heraldry on his pauldron, constituting a clear violation of Standard Uniform Protocol 447-B. While High Command has exercised discretionary tolerance due to his lineage, this allowance risks setting undesirable precedents among noble-born personnel. More concerning are the political ramifications should this perceived special treatment reach the Iron Creed's attention during current negotiations.

Of greater operational impact are the subject's unsanctioned training sessions with enlisted personnel. While not explicitly prohibited under Auxiliary Code 12.7, these activities have generated measurable discipline degradation within 3rd Auxiliary. Three junior officers have formally reported instances of enlisted personnel citing "the Scholar's methods" when challenging standard procedures. The most recent incident (see attached Audio_7742-9b) demonstrates this troubling pattern of indirect insubordination.

Psychological Assessment:
MedSec's evaluation (full report attached under Ref: Haelm/7742-9/Psy) confirms the subject exhibits classical Type 4-B guilt complex manifestations. While current loyalty markers remain within acceptable parameters, Dr. Haelm notes concerning fluctuations during routine psych evaluations, particularly when discussing Incident K-7742-9. Her recommendation for preemptive non-combat reassignment should instability thresholds be crossed remains valid, if politically inconvenient given the Bloodsworth connections.

Recommended Actions:
Given containment efficacy at Charon Outpost and the subject's above-average technical competencies, maintaining current assignment represents the optimal balance of utility and risk mitigation. However, surveillance protocols regarding Iron Creed contacts require immediate enhancement, with particular focus on Cardinal-Executor Orlan following their undocumented meeting on [REDACTED]. Preliminary evidence suggests this contact may represent more than simple spiritual counseling.

Furthermore, the Personnel Bureau should prepare standard reinstatement denial packages preemptively. Historical patterns suggest Marshal Beatrice will attempt to recall the subject upon her return from the Outer Reaches Campaign. Having Regulation 889 waivers and medical disqualification forms prepared in advance will prevent unnecessary delays when this inevitability occurs.
