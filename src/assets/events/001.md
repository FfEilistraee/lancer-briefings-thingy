To say that **Havelburg** is experiencing bad weather would be an understatement, yet the squad made its way through the heavy dustfall anyway, slowly trudging through ankle-deep sediment.

The hardsuits needed in these conditions make the trek from the nearest elevator no easier. The silhouette of the **Dynast’s Embrace** becomes more tangible with each thudding step, the floodlights all around struggling to illuminate its vast shape. To remove one’s enviro-helmet in these conditions would be to die, one inhalation enough to fill the lungs with dust and begin a slow and agonizing demise.

Dustfall is the name the inhabitants of Havelburg give to this phenomenon, and it has plagued huge stretches of the planet for the past decade – ever since the Disaster took place. While conditions aren’t usually this bad, the squad has chosen particularly poor timing for their meeting with **Lyran Stavros**, the man who’s meant to ferry them off this rock. Or at least, that had been the plan.

Painfully aware that the contracted and scheduled flight was set to depart in less than 24 standard hours, Lyran informs the group that the flight has been postponed indefinitely. He acknowledges the breach of contract, agrees to reimburse them, and offers to book them passage on whichever other ship departs in their direction – an event that could, despite the many ships that frequent the planet, easily take months to organize on account of most of them being company freighters, unwilling or unable to take on passengers.

At some point in the conversation, Lyran makes a request of the squad: knowing that they are lancers by virtue of already having loaded their mechs into the Embrace’s cargo bays, he implores them to help investigate **Emily**’s disappearance. Once she is retrieved, he will be able to take the group away from Havelburg – free of charge, of course. Additionally, he offers to take care of any expenses incurred during the investigation and is even willing to pay for the Mirrosmoke Mercenary Company's services on top of that.
