**LOCATION**: Marshal’s Court, **Macbeth** (**Cillon 2N0**)
**AUTHOR**: **Lieutenant-Colonel Veyra Sallis** (Sun Faction Liaison)
**SECURITY**: EYES ONLY — UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS PUNISHABLE BY **COURT MARTIAL**

**[BEGIN TRANSCRIPT]**

**Subject**: Status Update – **Altair Bloodsworth** (Domita-Spes Lineage)

**Current Status**:

    **Active Duty**: Assigned to 3rd Auxiliary Support Wing (formerly 1st Royal Vanguard).

    **Clearance**: Downgraded to Gamma-Level (no access to Silk Vault, War Council, or Fleet Movements).

    **Last Known Op**: "Crimson Harvest" (**Kessig VI** pacification—aborted by subject’s refusal to engage).

Psychological Profile (Per MedSec):

    Compliant but "showing signs of ideological friction."

    Notable Incident: During debrief, subject argued that Kessig rebels were "starving, not seditious." Filed formal protest with **HighCom** (denied).

Recent Activity:

    Attempted Reconciliation: Submitted three petitions to Marshal Beatrice IV for reinstatement. All ignored.

    Private Contact: Met with **Cardinal-Executor Orlan** (Faith Faction). Discussion contents unknown, but subject left visibly agitated.

    Current Assignment: Supervising "Waste Reclamation Unit" (glorified junk haulers) near **Charon** Outpost.

**Assessment**:
Subject remains loyal to Macbeth but is increasingly isolated from Sun Faction elites. His insistence on "moral conduct" is seen as weakness by HighCom. That said—

    Strengths: Still popular with lower ranks (common soldiers adore his "man of the people" act).

    Weaknesses: No allies in Moon Faction. If he falls further, no one will catch him.

Recommendation:

    Monitor for further dissent.

    If he fails his next mission, recommend discharge with prejudice (quietly—no martyrdom).

    Audio Snippet (Barracks Gossip): "He still salutes like he’s Royal Guard. Even the sergeants laugh behind his back."
