## WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED?

*Eyewitnesses* describe a scene of *unprovoked carnage* as **Ranran**â€”once a promising Lancer cadet before his **notorious expulsion**â€”suddenly **ripped his own mech apart** and **turned the debris on screaming fans.**

*"He wasnâ€™t even fighting his opponent anymore,"* claimed arena medic **Lira Voss**. "Just kept yelling about *â€˜cleansing corruptionâ€™* while swinging a severed actuator like a club."

## A PATTERN OF VIOLENCE

This isnâ€™t **Ranran**â€™s first brush with *excessive force*. First he was expelled after brutally **ASSAULTING** the grandson of a senior administrator. **NOW THIS**. His friend (uh oh readers) a fellow gladiator **Echo**â€”already under **investigation for radical ties**â€”reportedly *egged him on* before the rampage. Both are now in **Harrison** custody. It seems **his** violence can be tracked to the friends he **HAS MADE**.
