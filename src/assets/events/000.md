I wasn’t supposed to be here.

**Elysion-9** was the frontier’s golden child—freshly terraformed, rich in **Lumenite-M9**, and weeks away from declaring independence under the **Elysian** Accord. Then, the "Pandora Plague" hit.

Officially? A "viral outbreak." Bullshit.

I embedded with the First Wave Miners’ Union under a **Hephaestus Corp** contract. The workers called it "**the Shine**"—said it made the rocks glow. Said it made the water hum. Said their kids could see in the dark.

Then the first ship left orbit.

Patient Zero was a mechanic named **Rivas**. His veins turned blue. His skin cracked like porcelain. By the time **MedSec** quarantined him, he’d already coughed up a cluster of crystalline flowers. They called it a "lung infection." I called it a lie.

Three weeks later, the Accord collapsed. Hephaestus locked the Charon Gate. Only corporate barges get in or out now—sterilized, sealed, no survivors.

I found the real reports in a dead medic’s **COMP/CON**. Lumenite exposure isn’t a virus. It rewrites biology. Leave the planet, and it kills you. Stay, and you see the world like they do—through the Shine.

(Transcript Excerpt: "They’re burning the bodies in the pits. The flowers grow back. The company calls it ‘**decontamination.**’")

I tried to uplink this yesterday. My ’deck glitched. Someone rerouted my signal. Now my hotel door’s been forced, my backup drives are gone, and there’s a **Hephaestus CleanTeam** prowling the **hab-block**.

If you’re reading this, I’m already dead. Dig deeper.
