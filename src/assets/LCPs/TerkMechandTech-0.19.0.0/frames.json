A joint project between Exotic Materials Group and Urban Solution Group, the Dragontail is a frame designed for urban combat and redefining chemical warfare. Gone are the days of poisonous gasses and chemical burns, as the rise of mechs within the combat space means the old and cruel methods of chemical warfare are no longer effective. The Dragontail research team went back to basics, as what is chemical warfare if not merely chemical reactions? Exotic Material provided a dizzying array of hyper-reactive chemicals meant especially to combat mech, corroding their armor, clogging their vents, clinging to the battlefield as a looming cloud of death. Urban Solution Group provided the spark, ready to set the prepared chemical cocktail ablaze in a stunning display of the primal destructive power, as well as hypnotizing beauty, of mankind’s first and greatest invention, the Flame.</div>",

    "description": "<div>First identified among the underground dueling circles of the House of Smoke, the Heruka is a strange pattern group whose battlefield application stems from its original purpose as a training/simulation frame. Without the resources of sanctioned duels, the underground dueling circles cannot easily repair and refit their mechs, and thus resort to simulation strikes, where points are scored if the weapon would hit, without damaging the frame. This drive for ever greater simulation of a real fight led to the development of the predecessor to the Heruka, the Blue Lotus. Using a constantly updating database of battlefield information and a very powerful simulationist computer, the Blue Lotus was capable of simulating strikes to 99.9% accuracy, including subsequent damages and sub-system effects stemming from the attack, and with the capability of shutting its systems down or modifying them according to simulated results, allowing the duelist to go all out in a duel without risk of damage and getting all the results and feedback of real steel on steel contact.</div><div>With the blueprint circulating around the Omninet in hidden forums and chatrooms, it was only a matter of time before outside actors were able to gain access to its source code and make further modifications. The Heruka is a souped up version of the original Blue Lotus, capable of affecting real damage through its usage of simulated data. Using its powerful on board computer and electronic warfare system, the Heruka is able to feed false damage read-outs and feedback indistinguishable to the real thing into an enemy mech's systems, causing the systems to shut down as if it had been physically hit. After all, if the mech believes that a hose has been cut, then it will no longer send fuel through that hose, and thus the result is as if the hose has been actually cut.</div>",

This, in turn, leads to the Sunzi's R&amp;D project file being obtained by a Horus cell after a daring hack, and modified with esoteric technology to produce the Geryon. Where the Sunzi is developed to support its allies with multiple short blinkspace teleportation jumps, the Geryon is solely focused on maintaining a single stable localized blinkspace portal, a task which took up almost half the mech's weight to accomplish. In turn, the Geryon can draw immense power from this portal, turning it into a weapon by reallocating the portal to point to the heart of a star to decimate its enemies with the barely-contained power of the sun.</div>",

Small, sturdy and surprisingly dense, the Suleiman is made to be able to retract its limbs system into its reinforced shell, temporarily becoming nigh-invulnerable. Its spherical form, meanwhile, allows it to harmlessly roll around when struck by great force, whether from unexpected landslides, sudden mega-storm gale winds, or an onslaught from charging xenofauna. Its cockpit is gyroscopically stabilized and reinforced with anti-gravity generators and momentum dampeners, allowing it to keep the pilot upright and their drinks unspilled, emerging not much worse for wear even as it is thrown around its operational environment.</div><div>Though envisioned for civilian roles, the Suleiman has recently attracted interest as a war-theater mech for use in extreme battlefield conditions; its small frame and sturdy construction making it surprisingly resilient, able to trudge through just about any hostile terrain with little to no impact on combat effectiveness.</div>",

This is, in truth, a cover, and the Morgan is both finished and never going to be finished. The ongoing development fund for the Morgan project, which has never produced a frame and is eternally in development, provides cover for the cost of production and distribution of the actual Morgan chassis, which does not exist on any of IPS-N's logbooks.</div><div>Built as a deniable asset frame, the Morgan springboards off of the Blackbeard and Kidd specs to create a frame ramshackle in appearance, but extremely rugged and modular in design, operating independently without backup or official support for extended periods of time by interfacing with most weapons and being able to jerry-rig combat contraptions in the field.</div><div>To most outsiders, the Morgan appears as a run-of-the-mill, cobbled together frame, welded and riveted together by pirates in dimly lit shacks. IPS-N off-book operatives play into this fact as it provides the perfect cover for their wetwork, intentionally presenting a dinged up chassis barely able to support its own weapons, utilizing improvised explosives and overpowered scatterguns to make up for its cracked optics and bottom-barrel targeting systems.</div>",

Originally intended as the flagship of an upcoming line of mechs, the Togo has fallen victim to a vicious cycle of project creep due to its designation as “the cutting edge”. An executive would, upon being handed the reigns of the project, demand a new experimental feature to be added, so that it would bear their name as a flagship product when released. Then, by the time IPS-N Northstar Robotics figured out how to semi-reliably implement the feature, the old executive would have either retired or been promoted, and a new executive would have taken their place, with their own revolutionary idea that they, in turn, demanded to be implemented.</div><div>Nicknamed “The Eternal Prototype”, the Togo has a polarizing reputation amongst Northstar Robotics researchers. Some consider it a dead-end position that once they are assigned to can never leave, where their work will never see the light of day. Others consider it a blank check to do whatever they want with an effectively unlimited budget, as long as they can justify whatever it is they are adding to the chassis as “new and improved” to the board.</div><div>Despite dozens of other chassis having been released based on technology and systems that were tested on the Togo, the Togo itself has only seen live combat a handful of times, either as mandated field-testing, or when their source code leaked and a curious freelancer on the other side of the galaxy took it for a joyride. Whatever the case, the Togo is a temperamental chassis, and pilots need to carefully balance the whole host of experimental and poorly-documented features stacked on top of its aging reactor like a house of cards, barely capable of keeping up with the dozens of new systems it is attached to.</div>",
