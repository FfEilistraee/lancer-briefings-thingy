ASURA manifested in the systems of simulated mechs as a recode of HORUS’s PUPPETMASTER virus, hijacking friendly mechs and forcing them to act far beyond human capacity—at such speed and intensity that the g-force would kill organic pilots with the sudden amplified mass of their own bodies.<br>While these results were initially deemed a failure by Think Tank NHPs and engineers, it was enough to justify further study on ASURA. Personality and parasentience code was injected into the initial anomalous PUPPETMASTER strain, and first contact handled by Think Tank NHPs. Further societal acclimation and conditioning were fast tracked, giving Armory engineers the first iteration of ASURA after a decade of study, recoding, and reeducation. ASURA, as they exist now, is a scaled-back version of that initial manifestation: while retaining some of their initial impetuousness, ASURA clones now recognize the need to keep their pilot alive and will operate within parameters set by their pilot’s medical and psychological tolerances."},{"id":"ms_personalizations","uses":0,"destroyed":false,"cascading":false,"flavorName":"","flavorDescription":""}],"integratedSystems":[],"mounts":[{"mount_type":"Flex","lock":false,"slots":[{"size":"Flex","weapon":{"id":"mw_nexus_light","destroyed":false,"cascading":false,"loaded":true,"mod":null,"flavorName":"","flavorDescription":"Much like GMS mechs, GMS weapons are reliable galactic standards, made using interchangeable parts and built to withstand almost any conditions.
