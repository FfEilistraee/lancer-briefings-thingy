She hardly knew anyone on her own backwater outer-frontier planet, living alone, so when a Far Field team came through to induct them into Haven, she leapt at their offer to be licensed for her own Far-Field operations. Right now she's on her way to out from being freshly awakened, and she's already spent a lot of her sizeable income through interest on a Nelson License, for the sake of seeing what the corps have done in the years.</p><p>Of course there's some downsides, it wouldn't pay well if it didn't have any, but the breaks in-between expeditions where she gets to learn and experience new tech are enough to drown most of them out. Most of them... she had to give away her cat 300 years ago before her first expedition... she tries not to think about that. </p>",
