He eventually made his way into college, where he found his way into competing in pankration mekani, proving himself to be a real threat to some of the more senior members - especially when it came down to the cage fights. His very positive win record got to his head, as he began toying with those he decided didn't deserve his full attention. Fans loved his showboating -- his opponents loathed it. His flamboyant nature caught up with him eventually, leading to an eventual scandal that forced him to give up the sport entirely.<br><br>Looking for a career change, he signed up with the MSMC, where he passed with flying colors and began his career as a mercenary. Same as ever for Diego - he began to rise above the rest and make a name for himself, alongside the rest of his detachment. Before the rim knew of his name, he was snuffed out in a mission like any other.<br><br>Sometime later, he jolts back to life, realizing what went down. He was murdered, and was once again given a chance. The only thing he knows is the face of his killer, and he can't wait to see how that face contorts when they see a dead man walking.</p>","quirks":[],"current_hp":9,"background":"Pankrati","resistances":[],"mechs":[{"id":"d9a638c4-4dac-4e32-98b8-9d07709c6ef8","name":"Let's Talk","notes":"","gm_note":"","frame":"mf_standard_pattern_i_everest","active":false,"current_structure":4,"current_move":4,"boost":0,"current_hp":16,"overshield":0,"current_stress":4,"current_heat":0,"current_repairs":6,"current_overcharge":0,"current_core_energy":1,"statuses":[],"conditions":[],"resistances":[],"reactions":[],"burn":0,"destroyed":false,"defeat":"","activations":1,"meltdown_imminent":false,"reactor_destroyed":false,"core_active":false,"cc_ver":"ERR","lastModified":"Thu May 15 2025 16:46:40 GMT-0500 (Central Daylight Time)","isDeleted":false,"expireTime":"","deleteTime":"","portrait":"","cloud_portrait":"https://d1nurxym97qk9o.cloudfront.net/public/us-east-1:e8136a89-be4a-475e-a2ca-2deca7c0c60f/mech/Lets Talk.png","loadouts":[{"id":"c4f1dbae-c166-4c4b-a4f0-b779148984c9","name":"Primary","systems":[{"id":"ms_personalizations","uses":0,"destroyed":false,"cascading":false,"flavorName":"","flavorDescription":""},{"id":"ms_type_3_projected_shield","uses":0,"destroyed":false,"cascading":false,"flavorName":"","flavorDescription":"The GMS Type-3 Projected Shield traps and denies incoming projectiles by projecting an aggressive, superpositional anti-ballistic barrier."},{"id":"ms_rapid_burst_jump_jet_system","uses":0,"destroyed":false,"cascading":false,"flavorName":"","flavorDescription":""},{"id":"ms_armament_redundancy","uses":0,"destroyed":false,"cascading":false,"flavorName":"","flavorDescription":"By installing additional armor plating, redundant firing circuits, and enhanced insulation to magazines the longevity of a frame’s armaments can be greatly enhanced."}],"integratedSystems":[],"mounts":[{"mount_type":"Main","lock":false,"slots":[{"size":"Main","weapon":{"id":"mw_charged_blade","destroyed":false,"cascading":false,"loaded":true,"mod":null,"flavorName":"","flavorDescription":"Much like GMS mechs, GMS weapons are reliable galactic standards, made using interchangeable parts and built to withstand almost any conditions.
